# B-Hunt

B-Hunt is a very simple 2D game where you play as a character
called Fabien and try to survive against ennemies called Bertrand
who hunt you. You have ammunitions and health packs scattered
around the map in order to help you.
There is a simple score system based on the number
of Bertrand you kill and the waves you survive.

I'm making this project to familiarize myself with Rust
and the ggez crate.
